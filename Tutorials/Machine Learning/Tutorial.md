# Getting started Tutorial
This tutorial guides you through how to use Watson Studio and Machine Learning in IBM Watsonâ„¢ to make classifications based on Numerical Data.

## Before you begin
  * Create an instance of Watson Studio in your account.
    1. Search for Watson Studio in the catalog. Create a service and name it.

  * Make sure you have your Cloud Storage Set up.

## Step 1: Create a Project
1. Open the newly created instance of the Watson Studio and click on 'Get Started'.
2. Click on 'New Project' to create a new project and name it.

## Step 2: Add Machine Learning and Spark Instances
1. Go to the 'Settings' tab in the previously created project.

    3. Create a new instance of Machine Learning or select a previously created one from the options.
    4. The ML service should now show up in the 'Associated Services' tab.

  * #### Add Spark Instance
    1. Scroll down to 'Associated Services' tab and click on 'Add Service' and select 'Spark' 
    2. Create a new instance of Spark or select a previously created one from the options.
    3. The Spark service should now show up in the 'Associated Services' tab.    
    
## Step 3: Create a New Model
1. Go to 'Assets' tab in your project and scroll down to Watson Machine Learning Models.
2. Click on 'New Watson Machine Learning model'. Select the Machine Learning service and the Spark service that we created in the previous steps. Select Manual on data preperation option and click Create.

## Step 4: Add Data Assets
1. Open the new model that you created in the previous step and click on 'Add Data Assets'. You can drag and drop the CSV file.

2. Select the asset once it shows up and click Next.

## Step 5: Configure the Model
1. Depending upon the type of classification that you are trying to make, select the appropriate technique. The 'Column value to predict' requires the column that you want to predict.

2. Depending upon the type of classifier, select the estimator. Since this is a tutorial, select all to see the differences in the accuracy of the different models.

3. Click Next once you have selected the appropriate options.

## Step 6: Accuracy
1. The model will start training all the estimators you selected in the previous step. You can will be able to select the estimator that you want based on the PR and ROC curves.
