# Getting started Tutorial
This tutorial guides you through how to use Natural Language Classifier to classify textual data.

## Before you begin
  * Create an instance of Watson Studio in your account.
    1. Search for Watson Studio in the catalog. Create a service and name it.
  * Create an instance of Natural Language Classifier in your account.
    1. Search for NLC in the catalog. Create a service and name it.

## Step 1: Create a Project
1. Open an instance of the Watson Studio and click on 'Get Started'.
2. Click on 'New Project' to create a new project and name it.
